# Implementing Projectile Motion with Air Resistance as a Python Function

### Projectile Motion:
A fundamental idea in physics known as "projectile motion" describes how an object launched into the air would move under the effect of gravity when it is near the Earth's surface. In projectile motion, an object moves along a curved route or trajectory as a result of the combined forces of gravity acting on it and its starting velocity. There are two perpendicular parts to this motion: horizontal motion and vertical motion.
