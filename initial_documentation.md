# Implementing Projectile Motion with Air Resistance as a Python Function

### Projectile Motion:
A fundamental idea in physics known as "projectile motion" describes how an object launched into the air would move under the effect of gravity when it is near the Earth's surface. In projectile motion, an object moves along a curved route or trajectory as a result of the combined forces of gravity acting on it and its starting velocity. There are two perpendicular parts to this motion: horizontal motion and vertical motion.

### Projectile Motion with Air Resistance:
Compared to the idealized case where there is no air resistance, the reality of projectile motion is more complicated. When air resistance is taken into account, a further force that opposes the projectile's travel through the air influences its motion. This force is normally in the opposite direction of the projectile's motion and inversely proportional to the square of the projectile's velocity.

The primary consideration in projectile motion with air resistance is the **drag force (F_d)**.A projectile is thrown into the air. The drag force acting on the projectile will slow it down until it eventually stops and falls back to the ground. The drag coefficient of the projectile depends on its shape and size. For example, a baseball has a higher drag coefficient than a golf ball, so it will slow down more quickly. 
The drag force is given by the equation:

F_d = -k * v^2

Where:

- F_d is the drag force.
- k is the drag coefficient, which depends on the shape and size of the object.
- v is the magnitude of the velocity of the projectile.
